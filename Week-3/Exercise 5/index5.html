        <p>Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.</p>

        <p>Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</p>

    <div class="transparent">
        <p>Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.</p>

    <div class="red">
        <p>Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.</p>
