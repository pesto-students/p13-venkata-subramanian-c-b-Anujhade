            <P>Yesterday, All those backups seemed a waste of pay. Now my database has gone away. Oh I believe in yesterday.</P>

        <div class="song">
            <P>Suddenly, There's not half the files there used to be, And there's a milestone hanging over me. The system crashed so suddenly. I pushed something wrong, What it was I could not say.</P>

        <div class="song">
            <P>Now all my data's gone and I long for yesterday-ay-ay-ay.</P>
        </div>

        <div class="song">
            <P>Yesterday, The need for back-ups seemed so far away. I knew my data was all here to stay, Now I believe in yesterday.</P>
